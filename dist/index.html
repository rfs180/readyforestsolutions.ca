              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Stump removal extracts the entire root system below ground level, which is more intensive and costly. Stump grinding grinds the stump down to ground level (or below) and chips it into mulch, which is typically more affordable and leaves your yard ready for landscaping. Both options leave your property clean—we recommend grinding for most residential situations."
